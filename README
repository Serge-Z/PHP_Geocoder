# PHP GM Geocoder

A simple function that passes a request to the Google Geocoding API and returns the JSON object. Can be used to gather latitude/longitude coordinates for any given address/pseudo-address (or best guess), as well as supply missing information (eg, Zip Codes) for any given partial address.

## Notes:
* $latLng and $bounds are optional. This is called 'biasing,' used to return the result closest to a centerpoint ($latLng), and/or an rectangle specified by a SW and NE coordinate ($bounds).
* $latLng must be in '0.000,0.000' format (any number of decimals)
* $bounds must be in '0.000,0.000|0.000,0.000' format (SW coordinate, NE coordinate), (any number of decimals).
* The formatting functions are in place to handle the format generated by Google Maps JavaScript API v3 (eg, was used originally in AJAX-submitted form)
